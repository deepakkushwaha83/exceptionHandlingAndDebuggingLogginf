    "     e.g. C,C++,C# etc.\n",
    "     In Interpreted Language,In interpreted languages, the source code is not compiled into machine code all at once. Instead, an interpreter reads the       code line by line and executes it directly. This means the program is processed during runtime.\n",

    "# Q-2 What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "Ans->Exception handling in Python is a way to handle errors or exceptional situations that occur during the execution of a program, preventing the            program from crashing unexpectedly. Instead of letting the program stop abruptly when an error occurs, you can catch and handle the error                gracefully, allowing the program to continue running or at least provide meaningful feedback to the user."

When handling files, the primary purpose of the with statement is to automatically close the file after the block of code is executed, even if an exception occurs. This is particularly useful to avoid potential issues like leaving files open or not releasing resources properly."

    "Ans->Python's garbage collection (GC) system is responsible for automatically managing memory by reclaiming the memory used by objects that are no longer needed, preventing memory leaks, and ensuring efficient use of memory during the execution of programs. Python uses a combination of reference counting and cyclic garbage collection to handle memory management."

    "Ans->The else block in Python's exception handling system serves an important purpose: it allows you to run code only if no exceptions were raised in the try block. It gives you a way to separate the \"normal\" execution flow (when no errors occur) from the \"error handling\" flow (when an exception is raised)."
